What began as the Committee on the Status of Women, identifying, advocating for and increasing awareness of the needed changes in the University environment in order to enhance opportunities for women, evolved to become the Association for Academic Women (AAW). Today, the organization is dedicated to providing a forum for topics of interest to women, serving as an advisory group to the University Administration and supporting the professional development of faculty and administrative staff campus-wide.</p>
