                      <p>The Association for Academic Women (AAW) connects professional women throughout
                        the University of Florida community to enable personal growth, relationship building, career
                        development and lifelong learning - and to have some fun!!</p>
                        <p> We provide valuable networking and mentoring opportunities through special programs, social
                        events, and monthly networking luncheons; and act as an advisory group to higher administration
                        by providing valuable information on UF women's needs and desires. Our organization fosters career
                        and personal growth for UF women in all faculty, administrative, and professional roles by providing
                        an interdisciplinary, university-wide platform and encouraging the building and strengthening
                        of relationships among our members on and off campus. </p>

                      <p>Since its early beginnings, the Association for Academic Women (AAW) has been known for its rich history. What began as the Committee on the Status of Women, identifying, advocating for and increasing awareness of the needed changes in the University environment in order to enhance opportunities for women, evolved to become the Association for Academic Women (AAW). Today, the organization is dedicated to providing a forum for topics of interest to women, serving as an advisory group to the University Administration and supporting the professional development of faculty and administrative staff campus-wide.</p>
